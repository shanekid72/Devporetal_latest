# Development and Coding Guidelines

## Workflow and Planning

- First, think through the problem carefully.
- Read the relevant parts of the codebase before making any changes.
- Write a detailed plan of tasks in this file (tasks/todo.md).
- Always ask questions if anything is unclear; never assume.
- The plan should list actionable todo items that can be checked off as they are completed.
- Before starting work, present the plan for verification.
- After verification, begin working on the todo items sequentially.
- Mark tasks as complete as you go.
- At every step, give a high-level explanation of what changes you made.
- Keep every change as simple as possible, minimizing code affected.
- Security must be tight and production-ready under all circumstances.
- Before coding, adopt the mindset of "What would Mark Zuckerberg do in this situation?"
- After coding, thoroughly review the code for security best practices, ensuring no vulnerabilities or sensitive information exposure (e.g., no secrets, no .env files leaked).
- Before pushing to GitHub, double-check for security and correctness.
- Explain in detail what functionality was built, how it works, and walk through the code as if teaching a novice.
- Add a review section at the bottom of this file summarizing completed changes.
- Always check for syntax errors after writing code.

## Coding Environment and Technologies

- ReactJS, NextJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
- Modern UI/UX frameworks (e.g., TailwindCSS, Shadcn, Radix).
- Optionally, Framer Motion and Three.js for animations.

## Testing Preferences

- Always test new features and changes.
- Always test fixes after implementation.
- Perform a build after a minimum of 5 changes have been completed.
- Define "change" as a committed code modification that affects functionality or UI.

## Code Implementation Guidelines

- Prefer early returns for readability.
- Favor simple solutions over complex ones.
- Avoid duplicated code; reuse existing code if possible.
- Account for different environments: development, testing, production.
- Make only necessary changes related to the task, no unrelated modifications.
- When fixing bugs, try using existing patterns before introducing new ones.
- Keep the code clean and organized.
- Avoid scripts that run only once inside the codebase; use external scripts or manual processes.
- Limit files to 200-300 lines; refactor when longer.
- Mock data only for tests; never mock in dev or prod environments.
- Never overwrite `.env` files without explicit confirmation.
- Maintain DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.
- Ensure all changes and code are complete with no placeholders or todos left.
- Properly import all used modules and name components clearly.
- Always prioritize readability over cleverness or performance.
- If uncertain about requirements or details, ask clarifying questions before coding.

## Additional Best Practices

- Add a mandatory code review step before pushing code to main branches.
- Incorporate automated testing (unit, integration, E2E) as part of development workflow.
- Define and follow a branching strategy (feature branches, clear commit messages, pull requests).
- Perform a security checklist before every release (dependency scan, secrets check, input validation).
- Update documentation (inline comments, READMEs) when changing or adding features.
- Optionally perform performance profiling on critical features.
- Test on development, staging, and production-like environments before deployment.
